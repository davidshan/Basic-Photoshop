# Image-Editor

Created using Java and the Greenfoot engine for a school project.

The codebase was already established, but we were required to build upon it and add lots of different filters and functionalities.
I chose to add filters such as Greyscale, Gaussian Blur, Cool/Warm Effects, Brighten/Darken (and a couple more :) ).
We were further required to make it look clean/presentable, which I spent a while trying to get it to look nice.
All the methods for these are located within Processor.java, so take a gander at it.

Some more technical info:

-Background.java is the 'world' of the editor, containing all the positioning and overall design of the image editor
-ImageHolder.java is an 'Actor' where the image being edited resides (so that it can be properly inserted into the world)

Greenfoot utilises two superclasses World and Actor in order to 'populate' it's sandbox environment. If you do not have Greenfoot
installed on your device, I have included a compiled, exectuable file for you to use (ImageEditor.exe).
